# JSON Make Pretty - React Application

A simple React interface for prettifying JSON data with two text boxes - one for input and one for formatted output.

## Features

- **Dual Text Areas**: Input JSON on the left, see prettified output on the right
- **Real-time Formatting**: JSON is automatically formatted as you type
- **Error Handling**: Shows clear error messages for invalid JSON
- **Copy to Clipboard**: One-click copy of the prettified JSON
- **Clear All**: Quick reset of both input and output areas
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices

## How to Use

1. The application is now running at: http://localhost:3000
2. Paste your JSON data in the left text area
3. The prettified JSON will automatically appear in the right text area
4. Use the "Copy Result" button to copy the formatted JSON
5. Use "Clear All" to reset both areas

## Sample JSON for Testing

You can test the application with the JSON data that was in your `jsonPrettify.js` file - it's a complex nested object that will demonstrate the prettification capabilities.

## Development

The application was created with Create React App and includes:
- React functional components with hooks
- CSS Grid layout for responsive design
- Modern styling with smooth transitions
- Accessibility features

To make changes, edit the files in the `src/` directory:
- `JsonMakePretty.js` - Main component logic
- `JsonMakePretty.css` - Styling and layout
